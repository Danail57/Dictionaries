You will receive a single line containing some food (keys) and quantities (values). 
They will be separated by a single space (the first element is the key, the second â€“ is the value, and so on). 
Create a dictionary with all the keys and values and print it on the console.

data = input().split(" ")

stock = {}
for item in range(0, len(data), 2):
    food = data[item]
    quantity = data[item + 1]
    stock[food] = int(quantity)
print(stock)
